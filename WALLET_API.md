# Wallet API Integration Status

## Current Status

The wallet gRPC integration code is **implemented but not functional** due to missing protocol buffer definitions from the private IgraLabs kaswallet repository.

## What Works

- ✅ gRPC client infrastructure (Tonic 0.12.3)
- ✅ Protocol buffer compilation system (prost)
- ✅ Wallet balance querying method
- ✅ Wallet address retrieval method
- ✅ Transaction sending method

## What's Blocked

The kaswallet-daemon used in IGRA Orchestra is built from a **private repository**:
- `git@github.com:IgraLabs/kaswallet.git`

This custom implementation uses a **different protocol buffer definition** than the public kaspad version.

## Evidence

1. The `test_client` binary (which works) is compiled with the same Tonic version we use
2. Our gRPC client connects successfully but receives `Unimplemented` status
3. No log entries appear in kaswallet-daemon when we make requests
4. This indicates the service/method path doesn't match the server's expectations

## Next Steps

To complete wallet integration:

1. Obtain access to `git@github.com:IgraLabs/kaswallet.git`
2. Extract the correct `.proto` file from that repository
3. Replace `/tools/igra-cli/proto/kaspawalletd.proto` with the correct version
4. Rebuild and test - the code is ready to work

## Workaround

Until the correct proto is available, wallet information can be accessed via:
- Reading address from `keys/keys.kaswallet-N.json` files
- Using `docker exec kaswallet-0 ./test_client` for balance/transactions

## Files Modified

- `src/core/wallet.rs` - gRPC client implementation
- `proto/kaspawalletd.proto` - Proto definition (needs replacement)
- `build.rs` - Proto compilation
- `Cargo.toml` - Added tonic, prost dependencies
