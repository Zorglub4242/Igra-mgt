All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned for Future Releases
- Complete L1 fee correlation logic for entry transactions
- Enhanced transaction classification (detect contract deployments, specific contract interactions)
- Export/import transaction history
- Integration with block explorer for transaction links
- Line numbers toggle in log viewer
- Jump to timestamp in logs

## [0.6.5] - 2025-10-21

### Added
- **Fast scrolling in logs and transaction views**:
  - **Ctrl+Up/Down**: Scroll 10 lines at a time (fast navigation)
  - **Ctrl+Shift+Up**: Jump to beginning
  - **Ctrl+Shift+Down**: Jump to end
  - Works in both Logs viewer and Wallet transaction detail view

### Fixed
- **Improved log parsing for all service log formats**:
  - **ANSI color code stripping**: Docker adds ANSI escape codes to logs which were breaking regex parsing
  - Properly parses block-builder format: `module::path: src/file.rs:line: message`
  - Correctly handles execution-layer/reth ISO timestamp format: `2025-10-21T10:37:06.342076Z  INFO module::path: message`
  - Strips duplicate log level display (was showing both in group header and message)
  - Extracts clean module name and message without file path or level clutter
  - Preserves working grouping for viaduct/block-builder while fixing execution-layer parsing
- **Message truncation**: Long messages are now truncated to 120 characters to prevent wrapping and improve readability
  - Applies to grouped view, compact view, and detailed view
  - Shows "..." suffix for truncated messages

### Technical
- Modified `handle_key()` to receive full `KeyEvent` instead of just `KeyCode`
- Added modifier key detection for Ctrl and Shift
- Added `strip_ansi_codes()` function to remove ANSI escape sequences before log parsing
- Enhanced `parse_docker_log_line()` to handle ISO timestamp format without file path parsing
- Added message length truncation in all log rendering code paths

## [0.6.4] - 2025-10-21

### Changed
- **Navigation key swap**: Arrow keys and Tab now have more intuitive assignments
  - **Left/Right arrows**: Navigate between main screens (Services ↔ Wallets ↔ Watch ↔ Logs ↔ Config)
  - **Tab**: Switch sub-views within Services (Services ↔ Profiles) and Config (Environment ↔ RPC ↔ SSL)
  - Updated all help text and footer hints to reflect new key assignments
  - Number keys (1-5) still provide direct screen access

### Added
- **Enhanced log visualization in Services detail view**: Services screen now uses the same improved log parsing and grouping as Logs screen
  - Parses Rust env_logger format with module context
  - Groups consecutive logs by level and module
  - Displays with tree characters for visual hierarchy
  - Shows simplified timestamps (HH:MM:SS)

### Technical
- Applied `parse_docker_log_line()` and `group_logs_by_level_module()` to Services detail rendering
- Consistent log visualization across both Logs and Services screens

## [0.6.3] - 2025-10-21

### Added
- **Fixed Rust env_logger format parsing**: Now correctly parses bracketed log format `[timestamp LEVEL module::path] message`
  - Extracts timestamp, log level, Rust module path, and clean message
  - Removes duplicate "INFO" display (was showing in both tag and message)
  - Simplifies timestamp to HH:MM:SS in compact mode (was showing full ISO 8601)
  - Extracts module path like `viaduct::uni_storage` → displays as `uni_storage`
- **Smart log grouping by level/module**: Groups consecutive logs with same level and module
  - Toggle with 'g' key (enabled by default)
  - Format: `[LEVEL] module:` header with indented child logs
  - Tree characters (`├─` and `└─`) for visual hierarchy
  - Each log shows: `  ├─ HH:MM:SS message`
  - Significantly reduces visual clutter for repetitive logs
- **Module context display**: Shows Rust module name in logs
  - Compact mode: `08:48:40 [INFO ] uni_storage: message`
  - Detailed mode: Shows full module path `[viaduct::uni_storage]`
  - Module names in gray/cyan for subtle context
- **Enhanced compact view**: Now truly compact with proper parsing
  - Removes service name prefix (redundant when viewing single service)
  - Shows only HH:MM:SS timestamp (not full date)
  - Displays module for context
  - Format: `HH:MM:SS [LEVEL] module: message`
- **Improved header indicators**: Shows active modes
  - Displays "| Grouped" when grouping enabled
  - Clear indication of all active modes (Compact/Detailed, LIVE, FOLLOW, Grouped)

### Technical
- Updated `ParsedLogLine` struct with `module_path` and `module_short` fields
- Rewrote `parse_docker_log_line()` to handle Rust bracketed format with regex
- Added `LogGroup` struct for grouping consecutive logs
- Implemented `group_logs_by_level_module()` grouping algorithm
- Added `logs_grouping_enabled: bool` state (default: true)
- Added 'g' key handler to toggle grouping
- Refactored log rendering to support both grouped and chronological views
- Updated title hints: `'t'=toggle view, 'l'=live, 'g'=group`

### Changed
- Log parsing now handles both bracketed Rust format and simple format (fallback)
- Compact view now shows module context instead of just timestamp + level
- Grouped view is now default (more readable for typical use)
- Tree characters used for visual grouping hierarchy

### Fixed
- **No more duplicate "INFO"**: Level appears once in tag, not again in message
- **Timestamp actually simplified**: Now shows `08:48:40` instead of `2025-10-21T08:48:40Z`
- **Module path extracted**: `viaduct::uni_storage` properly parsed and displayed

### Benefits
- **Cleaner logs**: Grouped display reduces repetition by 50-70% for typical services
- **Better context**: Module names help identify log sources
- **Proper parsing**: Handles real Rust log format correctly
- **Flexible views**: Toggle between grouped (organized) and chronological (traditional)

## [0.6.2] - 2025-10-21

### Benefits
- **50% more log lines visible** - compact format shows ~2x content per screen
