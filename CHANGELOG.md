## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-18

### Added
- Full-featured TUI with 7 interactive screens
  1. Services - Monitor and manage Docker containers
  2. Profiles - Start service groups
  3. Wallets - View wallet addresses
  4. RPC Tokens - Manage RPC access tokens
  5. SSL Info - Check SSL certificates
  6. Config - View environment configuration
  7. Logs - Real-time log viewer with auto-scroll
- Real-time service monitoring with 2-second refresh
- Resource metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk usage)
- Network I/O monitoring (RX/TX) for each service
- Color-coded resource alerts (>80% red, >60% yellow)
- Interactive log viewer with auto-scroll
- Search/filter functionality for Services, Wallets, and Config screens
- Wallet address display (read from keys files)

- Tokio async runtime
- Complete codebase with all TODOs resolved

### Known Limitations
- Wallet balances require kaswallet-daemon gRPC integration (shows "N/A")
- Transaction sending UI implemented but requires gRPC backend
- RPC token generation not yet automated
- Backup/restore requires manual procedures

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-17

### Added

- Basic Docker integration via Bollard
- Docker Compose command execution
- Service status display
- Container listing and filtering
- Basic CLI commands (status, start, stop, restart, logs)
- Configuration management (view, validate)
- RPC token listing
- SSL certificate checking
- Wallet address reading from keys files
- Project root auto-discovery
- Service definitions for IGRA Orchestra

### Technical
- Core modules: docker, config, wallet, rpc, ssl
- Utils: constants, helpers, app_config
- CLI argument parsing with Clap
- Error handling with anyhow
- Initial documentation
